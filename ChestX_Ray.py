    Pneumonia can be caused by a variety of organisms, including:
    *   **Bacteria:** The most common cause of bacterial pneumonia.
    *   **Viruses:** Such as influenza viruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and coronaviruses (COVID-19).
    *   **Fungi:** Less common, usually affecting people with weakened immune systems.

    *   Cough, which may produce phlegm (mucus) that is green, yellow, or bloody.
    *   Fever, sweating, and shaking chills.
    *   Shortness of breath.

    Several steps can be taken to help prevent pneumonia:
    *   **Vaccinations:** Get your annual flu shot and the pneumococcal vaccine regularly, especially if you are in a high-risk group.
    *   **Good Hygiene:** Wash your hands regularly with soap and water, or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.
    *   **Avoid Smoking:** Smoking damages your lungs' ability to fight off infections.
    *   **Boost Your Immune System:** Eat a healthy diet, get enough sleep, and exercise regularly.
    *   **Avoid Close Contact:** Stay away from sick people as much as possible.
    *   **Cover Your Mouth and Nose:** When you cough or sneeze, use a tissue or your elbow.
